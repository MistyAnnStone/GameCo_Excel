This analysis provides marketing budget suggestions for a hypothetical video game company. 

## Scenario

It is October 2016 and the executive board of our hypothetical video game publishing company, GameCo, is planning the marketing budget for 2017. 
We assume that sales for the various geographic regions have stayed the same over time. 
Is this still true? Should we update our expectations based on our available data?

## Data Set
Our data includes historical sales data for the video games that sold more than 100,000 copies between 1980 and 2016. 
Included in our data set is genre, platform, and publisher, as well as the number of units sold in North America, Europe, Japan, and globally. 
The data is drawn from the website VGChartz.

## Results
### First Things First
This video game market is declining and is unlikely to be a profitable industry to enter.
The number of video games sold by year peaked in 2008 and has been declining since.
### Marketing Budget
GameCo should allocate even more of its marketing budget in the European region. 
GameCo should decrease its marketing budget in the North American Region region. 
Japanâ€™s market share may be increasing 2008-2016, but that market share is still not as high as North America and Europe. 
The Action and Shooter genres had the most sales in 2014.
